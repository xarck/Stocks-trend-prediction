# Stock Market Price Prediction using NLP and ARIMA

This project proposes a framework based on NLP and ARIMA that predicts the future trend of the stock market based on different stock-specific news articles. The framework is built to help investors maximize their profits by analyzing and predicting the future price of stocks with good accuracy.

## Background
Stock price prediction has always been an interesting topic for various data scientists and financial experts. Earlier, people believed that it is hard to predict the future upcoming trend of the stock market, but nowadays, with the help of big data generated previously by the stock market, i.e., historical data, one can analyze and predict the future price of stocks with good accuracy, and this task can be automated using machine learning tools and its algorithms.

## Techniques used
In the past years, many scientists and researchers have attempted to predict the trend of stock using different techniques which include the use of some machine learning algorithms such as ANN, Xgboost, Random Forest, Fuzzy models, etc. However, this project utilizes NLP and ARIMA to predict the future trend of the stock market.

## Dataset
The model is trained and tested on news articles of 8 stocks of NSE (Tata Motors, Infosys, Azure Power Corp. Ltd, Sify Techno Ltd, HDFC Bank, MakeMyTrip, Dr. Reddy's Lab Ltd, Wns Ltd.) in the first half of the year 2022.

## Results
The framework achieved an accuracy rate of 84.74% and 71.21% in case of the positive news article and negative news articles respectively, with an average profit of 16.77%. This is quite good, considering that the Nifty encountered a double-digit fall in the second quarter of the year 2022, which makes the overall stock market trend as bearish.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of utilizing NLP and ARIMA for predicting the future trend of the stock market, based on different stock-specific news articles. Investors can use this framework to make informed decisions on when to buy and sell their stocks, thereby maximizing their profits.
